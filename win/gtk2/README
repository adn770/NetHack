This document describes my reasons for developing Gtk2Hack and its goal.
It will serve as a reminder and reference so that I do not lose my focus.
Later the document might help contributers to understand (all?) design
decisions made in the process.

1. What is Gtk2Hack?
Gtk2Hack is a window port for nethack 3.4.x. This means it adds a GUI-frontend
to the popular ASCII-game.

2. Why did I start developing Gtk2Hack?
-the Gnome 1 window port got unmaintained and had some missing features (e.g.
 no permanent inventory, ugly preferences menu and player selection, too big
 icons in the status window...)
-with Gnome2/Gtk+2.0 there was a greatly improved new developer platform
-I wanted to increase my experiences with the C programming language
-I wanted to get to know the Gnome2/Gtk+2.0 platform
-fun!

3. What are the goals of Gtk2Hack?
-to provide a nice and clean frontend for nethack
-to support most (all?) features and configuration options nethack provides
-to never get in the way of the player and be completely keyboard controllable
 like the tty-version
-to improve the gaming experience by adding some eye-candy (different tilesets),
 making use of bigger screens and multiple windows to help the player and to
 more or less integrate in a modern destop environment
-to help new players play nethack by providing menus and/or buttons for most
 commands

4. What else could be done?
-internationalization of nethack?
-highscore window on demand
-autotools build system
-better mouse support (even drag and drop of equipment?)
